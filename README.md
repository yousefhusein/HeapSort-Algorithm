# What is heap sort?

Heap sort is based exclusively upon a binary heap data structure, where we find the largest element and sort it to the end of our unsorted collection. We use the properties of a complete binary tree to sort our collection efficiently.

## Time and Space Complexities

- Best Time Complexity: O(n log(n))
- Average Time Complexity: O(n log(n))
- Worst Time Complexity: O(n log(n))
- Best Space Complexity: O(1)
